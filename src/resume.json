    "summary": "I am a software engineer who has the gift and sometimes curse of seeing connections in places where other people cannot see them. I am passionate and inspired by the engineering beauty of all the principles that make the information technologies world the way we know it today. From the electrical circuits, semiconductors, and logic gates to the architectures of high-load information systems. By applying these principles, from the lowest to the highest level, we manage to cope with the tremendous complexity of solving modern business problems.\n\nI am a T-shaped professional with deep experience in building distributed web services in .NET and broad knowledge in other technology-related areas.",
